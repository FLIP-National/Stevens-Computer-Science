        <hr>
        <p>Well, I'm a small-town lad who has full parental permission to do whatever I want, even in difficult
            circumstances. My community is now adjusting to developments, but many political problems still occur, and
            my parents have managed to build their own school for the poor and offer the greatest education possible to
            the needy pupils. I could be a school board member right now, but I opted to do something out of the usual,
            so I'm here at Stevens. <br> During my college, I experienced a family circumstance that caused my score to steadily decline and have a
            backlog for a year, but I was eventually able to catch up. During the backlog period, I studied extensively
            and scored well, while also learning to code, which is still useful to me now.</p>
