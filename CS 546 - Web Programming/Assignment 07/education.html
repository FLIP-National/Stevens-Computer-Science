            <h2>Pillai College of Engineering</h2>
            <p>I attended Pillai College for my undergraduate studies. It was a fantastic journey that taught me a lot
                about the subject and provided me with many memories. I spent much of my time outside of class with my
                buddies and rarely attended class.</p>
            <aside>My professors were always encouraging, which helped me achieve a
                decent grade despite having a lot of fun.</aside>

            <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
            <p>I'm presently at Stevens after attending Pillai College. Even though I have only completed one semester,
                I have had a wonderful experience as an international student. My favorite class is Web programming not
                for sake of assignment, LOL but for the Web Development itself as I'm in web development ever since I
                started coding.</p>
            <aside>Almost everything here at Stevens is noteworthy since everything I'm experiencing is constantly fresh
                to me.</aside>
